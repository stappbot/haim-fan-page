        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <body>
           HAIM is a American pop band band from Los Angeles (or "lozenge-les" as I like to pronounce it). 
           <br/>
           They are three super amazing sisters who grew up with very musical parents. 
           <br/>
           Moti and Donna (their parents) taught them music from an early age with their cover band 
           <br/>
           "Rockinhaim." How cool is that!
